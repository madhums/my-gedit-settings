## My Gedit Settings

These are the plugins, snippets, styles I am using with gedit which makes my
development much easier.


## Install

Just run the install.sh. It will copy all the plugins and snippets to ~/gnome2/gedit/ 
Language specs are copied to gtksourceview folder (~/.local/share/gtksourceview-2.0/language-specs/)
Once you have run the install file, restart your gedit.
